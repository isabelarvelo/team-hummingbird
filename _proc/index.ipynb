    "## Motivation\n",
    "Manually labeling classroom transcript data is expensive, slow, and tedious. Our goal was to create an internal tool to help accelerate this process for our subject matter experts that \"learns\" while the user is labeling and iteratively creates better and better predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, our colleagues requested:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Something to help them label transcript data faster\n",
    "* A model to provide label guesses to review\n",
    "* The ability to ask questions about the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We met these needs by providing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interactive pages for assisted labeling\n",
    "* In-the-loop learning during manual labeling\n",
    "* Question answering directly using the transcript data"
